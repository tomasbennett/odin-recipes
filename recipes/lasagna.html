    </ul>

    <br />

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir the saffron strands into 600ml of boiling 
            water with the stock and set aside to brew.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large deep frying pan with a lid. 
            Tip in the chorizo and fry for about 3 mins until crisp 
            and the oil has been released.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the chorizo and drain 
            on kitchen paper, leaving the oil in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dice the chicken and stir into the pan and fry over a 
            high heat for 7-8 mins, or until the meat is 
            golden and cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>
            Pour another 1 tbsp of oil into the pan, 
            tip in the chopped onion and chopped garlic and 
            stir-fry for 4-5 mins, until softened and just starting 
            to colour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the pepper and paprika with the remaining 
            tablespoon of oil and stir-fry for a further 1-2 mins. 
        </li>
        <li>
            With the heat still quite high, quickly stir 
            in the rice so it is well-coated in the oil, 
            then pour in the saffron-infused stock plus 450ml 
            boiling water, scraping up the chorizo 
            from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the browned chicken pieces to the pan, 
            then add the chopped tomatoes. Cover the pan and 
            cook on a medium heat for 10 mins, stirring once or twice. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Scatter the peas, prawns and fried chorizo over the top, 
            cover again and leave to cook a further 5-10 mins, 
            or until the rice is just cooked and most of the liquid in the 
            pan has been absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the pan from the heat, 
            put the lid on and leave to rest for 5 mins. 
            Stir a few times to mix the ingredients, 
            season to taste and scatter over the chopped parsley. 
            Serve with lemon wedge.
        </li>
    </ol>
