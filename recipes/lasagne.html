    <p>
        Lasagne is a rich and hearty Italian dish consisting 
        of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternating with 
        fillings like meat sauce (ragù), béchamel sauce, vegetables, 
        cheeses, and seasonings. It's a popular comfort food known for 
        its indulgent flavors and satisfying texture.

    </ul>

    <br />

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 200ºC
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop 1 medium brown onion. 
            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger 
            regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high 
            heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 1 pound 
            lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 
            and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, and cook, 
            breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, 
            until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. 
            Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open 1 <em>(25 ounce)</em> jar marinara sauce. 
            Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of 
            a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce 
            into the ground beef mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese. 
            Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish. 
            Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the lasagne sheets. 
            Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, 
            then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange 5 more sheets over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup 
            of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, 
            and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 
            5 sheets and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin 
            so that it almost completely covers the sheets. 
            (Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for the end of baking.) 
            Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the sheets are done by poking 
            the lasagna with a knife; the knife should slide easily through 
            all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. 
            Bake uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, 
            and the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes 
            before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
